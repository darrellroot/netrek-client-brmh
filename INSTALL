BUILDING A BINARY
   
   First, do you need to build a binary?  There's a lot of client binaries
   available already built for a wide variety of architectures.  Check
   ftp://ftp.netrek.org/pub/netrek/clients/brmh/bin/ for existing BRMH
   binaries.

INSTALLATION
   
   1. Edit Netrek.tmpl, checking and/or setting CC, CDEBUGFLAGS, _RSA.
      If you want to use RSA, define MP_LIB (gnu MP) and MP_INCLUDE (gnu MP).
      If you don't have it, the GNU mp library is available from
      ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ or ftp://ftp.netrek.org/pub/netrek/gmp/.
      Set defined OPTIONS/FEATURES as desired to YES/NO.
      If you're not using RSA, set RSA_ to NO and skip to step 4.
      
   2. RSA: Get the latest RES-RSA code from
      ftp://ftp.netrek.org/pub/netrek/rsa/.
      It is now legal to export RES-RSA.  Contact vanilla-list@us.netrek.org
      or Dave Ahn (ahn@users.sourceforge.net) for details.

   3. RSA: 
      * xmkmf
      * make mkkey
      * If you have the secret RSA key already, do 'mkkey -k <key-file>'
	 otherwise:
      * mkkey key_name client_type architecture/OS creator comments
        (Be sure to quote arguments that have spaces or special shell 
	 characters)
      
   4. xmkmf; make depend ; make

CLIENT DETAILS
   
   * ./netrek -u for a description of command line options.
   * ./netrek -v for RSA version information
   * At runtime, select "show help window" for a list of commands.
   * At runtime, type ^s to display the list of features/macros/RCDs
