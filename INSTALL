BUILDING A BINARY
   
   First, do you need to build a binary?  There's a lot of client binaries
   available already built for a wide variety of architectures.  Check
   on cad.ics.uci.edu:/pub/netrek for the existing BRMH binaries.

INSTALLATION
   
   1. Edit Netrek.tmpl, checking and/or setting CC, CDEBUGFLAGS, _RSA.
      If you want to use RSA, define MP_LIB (gnu MP) and MP_INCLUDE (gnu MP).
      If you don't have it, the GNU mp library is available on 
      prep.ai.mit.edu.  Look for /pub/gnu/gmp*
      Set defined OPTIONS/FEATURES as desired to YES/NO.
      If you're not using RSA, set RSA_ to NO and skip to step 4.
      
   2. RSA: Get the latest RSA code from ftp.ecst.csuchico.edu (there's some 
      kind of legal problem with having RSA code in public distributions).  
      Contact trown@ecst.csuchico.edu for information required to decrypt 
      the RSA code distribution.

   3. RSA: 
      * xmkmf
      * make mkkey
      * If you have the secret RSA key already, do 'mkkey -k <key-file>'
	 otherwise:
      * mkkey key_name client_type architecture/OS creator comments
        (Be sure to quote arguments that have spaces or special shell 
	 characters)
      
   4. xmkmf; make depend ; make

CLIENT DETAILS
   
   * ./netrek -u for a description of command line options.
   * ./netrek -v for RSA version information
   * At runtime, select "show help window" for a list of commands.
   * At runtime, type ^s to display the list of features/macros/RCDs
