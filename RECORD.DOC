				Recording Info

			Recording xtrekrc resources

Resource	Type	Default		Meaning
----------	------	--------------	--------------------------------------
recordGame	Bool	off		Record game	
recordFile	String  noFileName.trk	Record filename
maxRecord	Int	0		Max. bytes to record, 0 for unlimited
recordIndiv	Bool	off		Record indvidual (personal) messages
confirmOverwrite Bool	on		Confirm before overwriting 
					  existing file

recordGame and recordFile can be overridden by command line arguments
specifying either the record file or the playback file.

If confirmOverwrite is on and you try to record over an existing file,
you are given the option of overwriting it, disabling the recorder, or
specifying a new record filename.  It's easy to forget which flag
you're using and accidently wipe out an existing recording while
trying to view it, so using this option is reccommended.


To record a game:
Either set recordGame (and optionally recordFile) in your .xtrekrc or
add the arguments:  -R filename.trk 
to the command line.  To make the recording compatible for viewing
with the paradise client, add the -Z command line option (see Paradise
Compatibility Mode below).

The ` key can be used to toggle recording on and off during a game.
If you are going to toggle recording off, make sure you wait at least
a minute (maybe a few minutes to be safe):  you need to get
certain packets sent near the start that identify your slot and
specify the server features or else things will be screwed up on
playback.  Toggling recording off and then turning it on a while later
has unpredictable results.  If you miss a player logging in, that
player will appear to be 'Independant'.  If someone changes teams you
probably won't pick that up either.  If you want the recording to look
good, don't use this key except to stop recording.



To playback a game:
<client> -F file.trk to playback the recording in "file.trk".   If
viewing a game recorded with the paradise client, enable the Paradise
Compatibility Mode mentioned below.  


Playback controls:
There's decent help available during playback, here it is again:

Continuous Play Mode: 
Enter this mode with 'C'.  Select the frames per second to use from
1-9, (0 is max speed).  + and - increment/decrement the frames per
second. 

Frame at a time Mode:
Enter this mode with 'F'.  The spacebar advances you a frame at a
time through the recording.

Scan Mode:
Enter this mode with 'S'.  You can scan for the next occurance of:
Red, Yellow, Green Alert, or Death.


Switch between modes by hitting that mode's key (C, F, S).
P pauses, Q quits, ? gives help on a key.  All commands work with
upper/lower case (except + -).  If there's a command you want to use
which is stolen by the playback stuff (e.g. P), you'll have to remap
it in your keymap.


Compatibility bugs with paradise:
Paradise doesn't support short packets version 11 (it uses 10), or the
SHIP_CAP feature.  If you don't record with paradise compatibility
enabled, paradise playback will be screwed up badly (even then, the
first ship may be messed up as viewed from paradise as it takes some
time to tell the server to disable SHIP_CAP).  Conversely, if
you don't playback a paradise recording in the brmh client with
paradise compatibility enabled, things will also be screwed up.


Paradise Compatibility Mode:  
To enable paradise compatibility mode, add the flag "-Z" to your other
client options.  Use this mode when recording or for playback to have
compatibility with the paradise client.


This compatibility mode will:
Use short packets version 10 instead of the current version 11.  You
may take a performance hit here if you play with fat UDP or with a lot
of ploss.  The improvements of version 11 over version 10, in Heiko's
words: 
"Biggest improvements is if you play with fat UDP. Otherwise it's
mostly good for playing with ploss.   PS: makes a difference of ~5%."

Disable the SHIP_CAP feature in the client.  If you are recording
while playing, the first ship still seems to use the SHIP_CAP feature,
but after that it doesn't, so in paradise playback your first ship
will look messed up but after that it will be fine.  If you are
observing then paradise playback will be fine once you lock onto a
ship.


Implementation:
For compatiblity with paradise recordings and for simpliclity, an
extra packet type 127 is recorded by the client when the screen is
redrawn so that we know when to display the packet info during
playback (also, some information about T/P status is recorded in the
fake packet).
