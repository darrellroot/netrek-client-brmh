2.2p3:
	* decreased weapon temp and engine temp bars to max out at
	  100%.  (suggested by John Salomon <john@csua.berkeley.edu>)

2.2p2:
	* buttonmap array extented (wbradley@sedona.intel.com)
	* self-selectable %p
	* window title (server name) got lost
	* metaserver - middle mouse button == observer
	* 500 macros allowed
	* fixed 24bit display problem
	* flag for using metacache as 
2.2p1:
	* metaserver "Chaos" for 'C'
	* Fixed galaxy ship problem (some client out there as incredibly
	  weird getship.c values for galaxy ship)

2.2:
	* limited .netrekrc created if no config file exists
	  (with reasonable geometry, new users only)
	* SHIP_CAP feature
	* obscure waitq feature
	* scrolled-text window scrollbars and scrolling functionality
	* compliance with ICCCM delete window 
	* observer support for INL (COW implementation)
	* udpClientReceive misspelled in .xtrekrc doc
	* MOO-bitmap fix for fontbased clients
	* fixed ICCM input focus problem (openlook)
	  (W_SetIconWindow was obliterating the input hint)
	* fork/exec now in place.

# Blink wait queue window instead of opening netrek window when in game.
noObscureEntry:                  off

# Scrollbars displayed on scrollable text windows.
scrollbar:                       on

# Maximum lines saved in each text window.
scrollSaveLines:                 100

# Scrollbars width. (Note that scroll control is allowed anywhere in a text
# window.)
scrollbarWidth:                  5

2.1:
	* metaserver output changed somewhat, added player list option
	* metaserver cache. Store results in ~/.metacache and use for 
	  the next 5 minutes ('metaCacheDisable: on' to defeat)
	  (also fallback in case metaserver down)
	* added 'mesgfont' option for message-window font 
	* configurable playerlist borrowed from COW-lite
	* re-fixed invisible plasma problem, was popping exploded
	  plasmas back into being.
	* no command-line arguments now asks player to use metaserver
	* added 'reportPhaserInReview'
	* 'shiftedMouse' on automatically if shift/ctrl/meta buttons
	  used in buttonmap
	* (metaserver window vfork/exec 'netrek' so window stays up
	   coded but not released)
------------------
2.0p17:
	* fixed old invisible plasma problem
        * SPII (Heiko Wengler)
	* fixed refresh problem after de-iconify
   [James Soutter:]
	* ship-specific keymaps (keymap-sc, ckeymap-ca, ..) are now an
	  extension of the default keymap (keymap and ckeymap).
	* keymap is now recreated when the defaults file is reloaded
	  so that removed key definitions will take effect.
	* The keymaps are now parsed more carefully.  Previously, the parser
	  would work passed the end of the definition string if the string
	  ended in the middle of a definition.  Also the parser
	  would not nasty things with definitions of the form `^<ctrl-a>a'.
	* Fixed the parsing of ctrl-shift buttonmaps.
	

2.0p16:
	* ship-specific keymaps [keymap-sc, keymap-sb, ...]
        * shrink phaser precision improvement
        * PHASER_FUSE_SEND feature (supported by calvin, server always send 
          phaser instead of skipping during rapid phasering), makes cleaning
          up dropped phaser packets trivial
   [remainder from James Soutter:]
	* Added stippleBorder (textured alert border) as an option for
	  color and greyscale clients.
	* Messages can now be entered from the warn window as well as
	  from the message window.
	* Added the code for COW's newdashboard and newdashboard2.
	* Added dashboardStyle to select between the available dashboards.
	  The option dashboard now implies dashboardStyle=1.
	* Redraw the galactic when the the galactic's bitmaps are changed
	  through the options menu.
	* Fixed main.c so that it will compile when RSA_ == NO.
	* Make rabbit-ear bitmaps a fourth bitmap style for the local map
	  The option newPlanetBitmaps now only effects the galactic map.
	  Previously I had been avoiding the rabbit-ear bitmaps because
	  it is difficult to tell the color (and hence the race) of a
	  stippled planet on a greyscale galactic.
	* Made a new function DrawLocalPlanets().  The new function
          replaces code from local() as well as the bitmap selection
	  functions like planetBitmap().  By moving code from local()
	  we hope to get better register allocation.  By including code
	  from planetBitmap() etc. we hope to speed the program up and
	  to improve clarity.
	* Previously, each local planets was printed twice if newPlanetBitmaps
	  was set.  The code has now been rewritten to prevent this.
	  As a result, race bitmaps can not longer be given rabbit-ears.
	  However, if rabbit-ears on race bitmaps was previously seen to
	  be important then race bitmaps would properly support stippling,
	  which they don't.

2.0p15:
	* puck direction indicator
	* tractor/pressor erase problem on b&w fixed
	
2.0p14:
	* metaserver update for new metaserver output
	* got rid of telnet, use read_port directly in who's playing -c
	  check
	* fixed restart defaults bitmap problem on black & white displays.
	* added extended-mouse features (shift, ctrl, shift+ctrl mouse)
	* extended usage message, WWW info

2.0p13:
	* exorcized two evil spirits possessing socket.c, fear they've
	  immediately take up residence in the RCD code
	* midnight seance conjured up spirit alleging to be Kevin P. Smith,  
	  I remain dubious because said person is presently alive and also
	  because spirit asserts that paradise is the only game in the
	  afterlife

2.0p12:
	* dec-alpha OSF1 changes
	* tstat window height now defined by font height
2.0p11:
	* logFile problem fixed
	* fastClear default
	* macrowin display for control characters
	* singleMacro fixed
2.0p10:
	* extended RCD window string buffer to BUFSIZ (160 too short).
	* rcd syntax error fixes

2.0p9:
        * middle mouse button no longer pastes if in remote message
          mode (i.e.cursor in tactical window).  Too easy to accidently
          paste.
        * paste semantics changed: first character/start-address now used 
          as destination for all lines of message.
        * limit 5 lines pasted.
        * waitq string problem when 600 -> 0 fixed
        * waitq windows not unmapped, fixed.
2.0p8:
	* maxwarpi removed -- concept flawed, most people miss maxwarp
	  because the packet was dropped, not because they didn't
	  hit the maxwarp key 
	* default tactical planet name mode back to original
	* message time-stamping
	* -c -- who's playing flag
	* -m -- metaserver window (Nick Trown's code from COW)

2.0p7:
	* det/torp timechecks to prevent dets/torps from being sent < 100ms
	  interval (limiting dets makes a big difference in fuel and
	  wtemp during autorepeat).

2.0p6:	* fixed send-message redraw on expose
	* added paste with middle mouse button to message window
	  if message pending

2.0p5:
	* added reportAllInReview, reportTeamInReview, reportIndInReview 
	  to selectively send resp. messages to the all-messages window.
	* added shrinkPhasers, shrinkPhasersAmount on suggestion from
	  Herbert Enderton:
			(tick 0)   ME----------HIM
			(tick 2)   ME  --------HIM
			(tick 4)   ME    ------HIM
			(tick 6)   ME      ----HIM
			(tick 8)   ME        --HIM
	* fixed crash in save-motd

2.0p4:
	* feature: hockey cosmetic stuff - puck bitmap, no letter on 
	  tactical, 'P' on galactic, better redraw of puck on galactic.

2.0p3:
	* fixed: ignore-multi-line removed.  It doesn't work.
	* fixed: %u now tclose_j (any player) instead of just enemy
	* added reportKillsInReview variable to selectively send
	  kill messages to the all-messages window

2.0p2:
	* fixed: TTS fix for non-new-message servers
	* fixed: keeppeace true by default (not taken from server)

2.0p1:
	* fixed: waitq window doesn't update, ghostbusts
	* fixed: etemp not displayed correctly
